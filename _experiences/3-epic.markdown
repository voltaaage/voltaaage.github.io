* **Technical Services Engineer**
* Aug 2012 - Feb 2016
* Seattle, WA

As a technical services engineer, my core responsibility is to ensure the success of my customers. I resolved complex issues with the hospital's electronic medical record software. Various troubleshooting techniques were used to perform my daily duties such as system configuration analysis, code debugging, research, and consulting domain experts. I successfully supported 5 hospital organizations through 10 software upgrades with minimal issues during the transition. I also volunteered for go-live support shifts and supported over 20 hospital organizations across the country during their software go-lives, providing valuable guidance to physicians and nurses on how to effectively use the software.

To improve my problem solving abilities, I took courses in Cache, Visual Basic, and C#. I routinely used coding knowledge to track down bugs, analyze data, and troubleshoot issues. I also took on software development projects in my spare time. One notable project is the development of a highly requested feature to filter documented data by healthcare disciplines, saving roughly 2 minutes on a workflow performed 10 times a day per doctor.

As the lead for Project Galileo, I led a team of 10 peers to develop scripts that extracted vital upgrade information for our customers, saving roughly 100 hours of effort per system upgrade per customer.
