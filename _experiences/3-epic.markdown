* **Technical Services Engineer**
* Aug 2012 - Feb 2016
* Seattle, WA

As a technical services engineer, my core responsibility is to ensure the success of my customers. I resolved complex issues revolving around hospital electronic records. Various troubleshooting techniques were used to perform my daily duties such as system configuration analysis, code debugging, research, and contacting experts. I successfully supported 5 hospital systems over 10 software upgrades with minimal issues during the transition. I also volunteered for shifts and supported over 20 hospital organizations across the country during their software go-lives, providing valuable guidance to physicians on how to effectively use the software.

To improve my problem solving abilities, I took courses in Cache, Visual Basic, and C#. I routinely used coding knowledge to track down bugs, analyze data, and troubleshoot issues. I also took on small software development projects in my spare time. One notable achievement is the development of a highly requested feature to filter documented data by healthcare disciplines, saving 2 minutes on a workflow performed 10 times a day per doctor.

As the lead for Project Galileo, I led a team of 10 TS to develop scripts that extracted vital information for our customers, saving roughly 100 hours of effort per system upgrade per customer.
