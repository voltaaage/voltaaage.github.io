At Siimpl, I worked on projects for Instructure's Professional Services team and developed React/Rails applications for their clients. These applications followed the LTI standard and they integrated with Canvas (Instructure's core LMS platform). I built a variety of features ranging from constructing API requests, fine tuning and building background jobs, developing front end interactions.

In our down time, I developed the reporting and metrics features on Time Management - our internal project and resources tracking application. Tools used: React.js, Rails, Grommet, D3, Docker.
